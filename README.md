# Route-Mapping

### Summary

This was a fun Java Project done for school that basically implemented a rudimentary mapping system utilizing the Graph data structure, Dijsktra's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm. 

The program takes a file containing all the locations and roads of a certain area, then draws a map of the data. The user can either input "directions", or two locations to get the shortest distance between, or input "meridianmap", which will get the shortest possible distance needed to traverse every possible location in the area.
